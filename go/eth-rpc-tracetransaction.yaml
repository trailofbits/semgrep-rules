      Using built-in transaction tracers can be dangerous if measures are not taken to filter out reverted call frames. 
      Review the related code to ensure the following properties: 
      1. Reverted call frames and their associated subtraces are filtered out from any analysis.  
      2. The transaction being traced is from a finalized block.
    severity: WARNING

      likelihood: MEDIUM
      description: Detects attempts to extract trace information from an EVM transaction or block. In exchange or bridge applications, extra logic must be implemented encapsulating these endpoints to prevent the values transferred during reverted call frames from being counted.
