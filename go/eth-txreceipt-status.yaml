    message: >-
      A transaction receipt's status is inspected using `$RECEIVER.Status()`. For bridges and exchanges, this is a high-risk pattern because even though the transaction was successful, calls within the transaction may have failed. Review the related code to ensure the following properties: 
      1. The receipt's success is not being used as a verification measure.
      2. The transaction being inspected is from a finalized block.
